		<div class="content">
			<p>You're riding with a friend, family member, coworker, or maybe even an Uber driver. Then the unexpected happens, you're in a car accident, and as a passenger, you're injured. An injury as a passenger is more complicated than an injury as a driver. When you're the driver, you can work with the insurance companies directly. However, as a passenger, you have to evaluate other opportunities to recover the compensation that you deserve.

  	<li id="2"><a href="#2" class="button js-button" role="button"><h1>What is the timeline during a personal injury lawsuit?</h1></a>
		<div class="content">
		  	<p>While there is no such thing as a 'typical' personal injury case, there is a rough timeline on what to expect. Each aspect may take days, weeks, or months, but overall, the effort put in is worth it. When you are struggling to pay bills or to recover from an injury that came from someone else's carelessness, a lawsuit may be your only chance to recover.
		  	<br>
		 	<br>The initiation of the entire issue starts with an accident. Personal injury cases cover a massive range of injuries. The basis that ties them all together is that they resulted from someone else's negligence.The most common type of personal injury case is a car accident injury. Other injuries, however, can stem from issues with property maintenance such as poorly maintained trees, exposed roots, dangerous structures and the similar. Dog bites also fall into personal injury. No matter the accident, if you took on any injury because someone failed to provide a proper level of care, you can start a case.
		  	<br>
		  	<br>Immediately after any injury, you should seek medical help. It's a notorious issue after a car accident that people don't seek medical attention because they 'feel fine,' but that's not the case. If you were in a car wreck, slipped on someone's property, or were bitten by a dog, then see a doctor.
		  	<br>
		  	<br>After taking on an injury, you likely have some outstanding medical bills. You may have even had to miss time from work, and your recovery may be financially taxing as well. Work with an attorney at AAA Legal to start a claim to recover a fair amount of compensation for your injuries. Legal representation is not always easy to find, but fortunately, with a contingency-fee, it may be affordable. Interview attorneys to learn more about their experience and current workload before deciding on who to hire. A prominent law office may shuffle you around from paralegal to paralegal while a small law office may not be able to take on another case. Ask questions and learn more about their process.
		  	<br>
		  	<br>After you find an attorney, you'll officially start your case. They will want to investigate your claim and begin reviewing any evidence thoroughly. With a car accident, this part is fairly easy. Many people know that they should carefully document the crash scene and file a police report. However, in other personal injury situations that may not be the case. For example, in slip-and-fall cases, many people leave the scene immediately either to go to the hospital, an urgent care center, or home to rest. They may not have taken any pictures or have filed any formal reports. The demand for investigation will depend on your case and the unique aspects that come with your situation. While the previous steps in your case may have gone by quickly, the investigation and review step can take weeks or even months. If your case relies heavily on witness statements, it may take time to depose and interview each person involved. Give this stage of the case time.
		  	<br>
		  	<br>Many cases reach a settlement agreement before going to court. For many people and attorneys, a settlement is a preferable method for resolution. To initiate a settlement negotiation, you will work with your attorney and possibly some financial experts to issue a demand. A demand is you officially informing the insurance company, or the private party involved that you expect that set dollar amount in compensation for your injuries. However, that does not mean that you're guaranteed that amount. The other legal team or insurance company may return your demand with an offer, most likely lower than what you requested. You and your attorney will need to work together to decide if a settlement offer is worth accepting.</p>

  	<li id="3"><a href="#3" class="button js-button" role="button"><h1>How long do you have to file a personal injury claim in Florida?</h1></a>
		<div class="content">
			<p>If you have an applicable personal injury, then you have approximately four years to file a claim. However, the nuances that come with any legal situation make this clear-cut answer a little challenging to handle at times. Most cases will have four years from the date of the injury. When filing an insurance claim, you need to understand that the window is part of your policy, often that window is only 30-days</p>
	</li>  

  	<li id="4"><a href="#4" class="button js-button" role="button"><h1>Why should I hire a personal injury attorney?</h1></a>
		<div class="content">
			<p>When you need your car repaired, you take it to a mechanic. When a pipe leaks in your home, you call a plumber. The same thought process should rule handling legal issues. If you have an injury because of someone else's careless acts, you need to hire a personal injury attorney. Not that every accident is cause for legal action, but there are many situations where people believed that the appropriate insurance company would resolve the matter and then they are left in the lurch. Hiring a personal injury lawyer at AAA Legal can take some of the stress off of these situations.</p>
